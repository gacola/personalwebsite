    <h1>Hello, I'm Gavin</h1>
    <p>Federico Fellini in the flesh
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Bitch I been brackin' since the '80s
Google me baby, you crazy
'89 in London pull the Benz up
Type it in, Google's your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer and still counting
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit
IRS should've had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that's for Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it's like multiple choices
I told 'em pull the Royce up
I'm getting ghost, I'm hearing noises
I think it's the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries 'em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley 'bout me
Ask the Federalis 'bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, "Gimme 12"
He told them to go to hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y'all think Uber's the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take 'em to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
I'm a course of miracles with this shit
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Herein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn't find a decent job
Life made me ambidextrous
Countin' with my right, whipping' white with my left wrist
Daaaaaaaamn Daniel
FBI keep bringing them all white vans through</p>
